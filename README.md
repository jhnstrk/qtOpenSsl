# qtOpenSsl
Light Qt wrapper for crypto functions provided by OpenSSL

The purpose of the project is (currently) just for me to explore the OpenSSL
library functions.

Qt provides access to the hash functions: See QCryptographicHash
http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qcryptographichash.html
However, reversible encryption is not covered.
